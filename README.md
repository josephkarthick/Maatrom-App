<h1> Scheduler - BookMe </h1>

This is an assessment project demonstrating my ability to build a scheduling system that displays a calendar with people's availability status.

<h2>  How to Run</h2>

Open the Command Prompt (CMD) from the bookme folder (which contains manage.py).

<h2>Run the following command:</h2>

manage.py runserver 80

<h3> Note :</h3>   There is no need to activate a virtual environment as it is not used in this assessment.

You will be redirected to the home page, where you can view the date availability dashboard.

<h2> Note </h2>

<i> Due to a hectic office schedule and a client visit, I was unable to refine this assessment further. Given more time, I am confident that I can meet all expectations and enhance the project significantly.</i>
